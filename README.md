## About

This software package includes a range of modules and subsystems to work
with CrateDB and CrateDB Cloud efficiently.

You can use CrateDB Toolkit to run data I/O procedures and automation tasks
of different kinds around CrateDB and CrateDB Cloud. It can be used both as
a standalone program, and as a library.

It aims for [DWIM]-like usefulness and [UX], and provides CLI and HTTP
interfaces, and others.


## Install

Install package.
```shell
pip install --upgrade cratedb-toolkit
```

Verify installation.
```shell
ctk --version
```

Run with Docker.
```shell
alias ctk="docker run --rm ghcr.io/crate/cratedb-toolkit ctk"
ctk --version
```

## Contribute

Contributions are very much welcome. Please visit the [](#sandbox) documentation
to learn how to spin up a sandbox environment on your workstation, or create
a [ticket][Issues] to report a bug or propose a feature.

## Status

Breaking changes should be expected until a 1.0 release, so version pinning is
strongly recommended, especially when using this software as a library.
+For example:
+```shell
+pip install "cratedb-toolkit==0.0.38"
+```
