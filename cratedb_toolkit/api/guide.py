        Excellent, that worked well.

        Now, you may want to inquire your data. To do that, use either CrateDB Admin UI,
        or connect on your terminal using `crash`, `ctk shell`, or `psql`.

        The CrateDB Admin UI for your cluster is available at [1]. To easily inspect a
        few samples of your imported data, or to check the cardinality of your database
        table, run [2] or [3]. If you want to export your data again, see [4].

        [1] {self.admin_url}
        [2] ctk shell --command 'SELECT * FROM {self.table_name} LIMIT 10;'
        [3] ctk shell --command 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {self.table_name};'

        That went south.
